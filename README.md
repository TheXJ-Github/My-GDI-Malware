## Description
This repo contains all of my public GDI Malware<br>
Sure, some I create won't be available here, but it's fine! I just may not want to distribute

### Passwords
All archive files are password protected, it being **xjgdimalware**

### My Thoughts

I agree with Enderman, that Malware can be fun to play with as long as you know what you're doing.<br>
And if you're someone that types "google.com" into the search bar, you don't know what you're doing.

I hope to contribute to his efforts of saving malware, because I like playing around with malware, and seeing what they do!<br>
If you haven't seen my YouTube channel (which you should subscribe to), I have numerous videos on malware!
